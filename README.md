There are four different states: underweight, healthy, overweight and obese.
The "obese" state has three obesity classes to determine how severe the obesity is.

The program is will suggest the user a target weight that is the closest to the 
user's current height and is considered healthy. It also goes into detail, displaying
how much weight the user should either gain or lose.
