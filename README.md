# BMI_Calculator
A fully functional BMI calculator that works with both the metric system and the US units.
Here are the simple instructions:
1. Type in your height (meters/feet and centimeters/inches have separate boxes).
2. Type in your weight in either kilograms or pounds, depending on the units you use.
3. Submit the results and your BMI will be displayed underneath the button you pressed.

There are four different states: underweight, healthy, overweight and obese.
The "obese" state has three obesity classes to determine how severe the obesity is.

The program is will suggest the user a target weight to reach as a goal in order to
be considered "healthy".
