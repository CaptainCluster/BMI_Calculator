This file contains my plans for the future of this repository.

1. More dynamic HTML, as a whole. Perhaps buttons that change colors
when the user has done something.

2. To have only one input box for the user's height

3. Support for other languages, perhaps.

4. Report errors to the user

5. A more appealing way to display the results
